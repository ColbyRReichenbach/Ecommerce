## E-Commerce Business Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following analysis provides a comprehensive look at customer behavior, financial performance, and operational efficiency. These insights will guide strategic decision-making to improve customer retention, optimize logistics, and drive revenue growth.

1. ### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis
Customers exhibit a broad range of lifetime values, with high-value customers making large purchases, while some contribute minimal revenue.
Identifying and retaining high CLV customers should be a key focus, potentially through loyalty programs or personalized offers.
2. ### Repeat Purchase Rate
The repeat purchase rate is 3.00, indicating that, on average, customers place approximately three orders.
A low repeat purchase rate may suggest a lack of customer retention efforts, emphasizing the need for post-purchase engagement strategies.
3. ### Churn Rate (Customers Inactive for 6+ Months)
The churn rate is 97.15%, indicating that the vast majority of customers do not return after an initial purchase.
This signals an urgent need for customer retention strategies, such as targeted email campaigns, discounts for returning customers, and personalized recommendations.
4. ### Average Order Value (AOV)
The AOV is $137.75, which is relatively high but could be improved with bundling strategies or free shipping thresholds.
Offering incentives for larger purchases could further increase order values.
5. ### Payment Method Performance
Credit cards dominate transactions, contributing to $12.54M in revenue (76.8K transactions).
Boleto (bank slip payments) account for a smaller portion ($2.87M, 19.7K transactions), and alternative payment methods have even lower adoption rates.
Optimizing payment options by expanding support for digital wallets and installment plans could improve conversion rates.
6. ### Revenue Trends Over Time
A steady increase in revenue is observed from 2017 onward, peaking in November 2017, likely due to seasonal sales (Black Friday, holiday shopping).
Revenue declines after May 2018, suggesting post-holiday slowdowns or potential retention issues.
7. ### Estimated Return Rate
The return rate is estimated at 64.78%, which is significantly high.
A high return rate can indicate product quality concerns, inaccurate product descriptions, or issues with expectations vs. reality.
Enhancing product descriptions, images, and customer education could mitigate excessive returns.
8. ### Top-Selling Product Categories
Bed, Bath & Table, Health & Beauty, and Sports & Leisure are the top-performing product categories.
These categories should be prioritized for marketing campaigns, promotions, and restocking strategies.
9. ### Customer Satisfaction (Review Scores)
57.8% of customers left 5-star reviews, indicating a strong satisfaction rate.
However, 11.46% of reviews are 1-star, highlighting a notable dissatisfaction rate.
Further analysis is needed to determine root causes of negative reviews, whether related to delivery issues, product quality, or customer service.
10. ### Average Review Response Time
The average review response time is 2.58 days, which is fairly quick.
Faster response times can increase customer trust and improve retention. Automating responses or prioritizing critical cases could enhance customer experience.
11. ### Average Delivery Time vs. Estimated Delivery Time
Actual delivery time: 12.09 days
Estimated delivery time: 23.37 days
Deliveries are significantly faster than estimated, which is a positive factor in customer experience.
However, overly conservative estimates could dissuade potential buyers. Adjusting delivery estimates closer to actual times might improve conversion rates.
12. ### Shipping Cost Per Order
The average shipping cost per order is $19.99.
High shipping costs can deter customers from completing purchases. Negotiating better logistics rates or offering free shipping thresholds could help improve conversion rates.

## Project Overview
This project delivers an internal analytics dashboard for an e-commerce business, leveraging Python and Streamlit to transform 2.5 years of sales, customer, and product data into actionable intelligence. The system provides stakeholders with real-time, intuitive visualizations of key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends. It enables dynamic exploration of business performance through filters for date ranges and customer geography, directly supporting data-driven decision-making for marketing, sales, and inventory management.
